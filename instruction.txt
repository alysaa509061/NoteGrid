# MatrixView - Expo Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to ensure the app works as a functional Expo application:

## 1) Edit package.json

Remove the React 19 line and keep only this:

"react": "18.2.0",

So your dependencies should include:

"react": "18.2.0",
"react-dom": "18.2.0", 
"react-native": "0.74.1"

## 2) Clean install (important)

From your project folder:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
rmdir /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 3) Run Expo

Your script is "dev": "EXPO_NO_TELEMETRY=1 expo start"
But safer to run:

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

OR if you want to use the script:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Additional Notes

- The `-c` flag clears the Metro cache, which helps prevent bundling issues
- Make sure you have Expo CLI installed globally: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
- Use Expo Go app on your phone to scan the QR code and test the app
- For web testing, press 'w' in the terminal after starting Expo

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter Metro bundling errors:
1. Stop the development server
2. Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start -c`
3. If issues persist, delete node_modules and reinstall dependencies

## Project Structure

This is a React Native Expo app with:
- File-based routing using Expo Router
- Tab navigation for main screens
- Local storage for data persistence
- Dark theme with custom color palette
